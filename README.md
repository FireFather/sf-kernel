# sf-kernel
A warning-free, standards-clean Stockfish 16 kernel...a minimal Stockfish-derived chess engine core

sf-kernel is a stripped-down, modernized, and aggressively cleaned extraction of the Stockfish 16 engine core, designed to serve as a minimal, embeddable, analyzable chess engine kernel.

It focuses on:

• Deterministic, warning-free builds
• Strict standards correctness (MSVC / Clang / GCC / MinGW)
• Minimal code surface and binary size
• Clean move generation, search, and evaluation core
• Maximum suitability for embedding, study, and research

All non-essential layers — UCI front-end glue, debugging infrastructure, legacy compatibility shims, and platform clutter — have been removed or rewritten.

The result is a tiny, fast, transparent Stockfish kernel suitable for:

• Game engines
• Chess AI research
• Reinforcement learning backends
• Engine embedding
• Minimal chess programs
• Code analysis and teaching

🔬 What Makes sf-kernel Different
Source code footprint size:	~680 KB	has been reduced to ~218 KB
Compiler warnings reduced from 3029 to 24 (via MSVC / Resharper / Clang analysis)
Build surface: Large to Minimal
Dependencies: Many to Tiny
Embeddable: Hard to Easy
Readability: Low to High

sf-kernel preserves Stockfish’s world-class playing strength while making the engine auditable, portable, and clean.

🧠 Core Philosophy

sf-kernel treats Stockfish as a kernel, not an application.

Everything unnecessary for pure chess intelligence has been cut away.
